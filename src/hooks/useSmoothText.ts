 * Typewriter buffer for streaming text. grok delivers tokens in fast bursts,
 * so rendering the raw accumulated text makes it lurch out in chunks. This
 * hook reveals the accumulated text at a steady, natural cadence (Claude-like)
 * — a single rAF loop advances a "shown" cursor toward the full length, a few
 * characters per frame, with mild catch-up so it never lags a whole paragraph
 * behind. When the run ends it snaps to the full text immediately (no
 * artificially withheld tail).
